================
This is meant to be a repo for all the Salesforce stuff I do.

To upload:
* Salesforce to Locus Energy API
	- generation numbers and automated OAuth/token generation
* Salesforce to Enphase Energy API
	- errors, generation, summary
* Salesforce to PVwatt v2 and v4 API
	- estimated monthly generation based on location/system_size/derate
* Work Order Form PDF Generation
	- push button PDF form generation for making work orders on custom objects and Cases

I'll be uploading each as separate repos.
